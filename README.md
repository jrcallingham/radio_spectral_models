# radio_spectral_models

Python code of models used to describe different emission and absorption models to radio sources, paricularly peaked-spectrum sources (GPS/CSS models). All models are coded in linear space. Addition of spectral breaks and curvature is also included for the various models.

Only numpy and scipy are required for the package.
